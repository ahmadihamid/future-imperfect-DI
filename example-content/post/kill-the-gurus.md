Well, actually don't kill them. Deep down, some are nice people just trying to get by. Their only way to keep the conversation going is to write tidbits of thought sometimes with little basis or any comment to sustain the statement.

To me, they mostly sound like this guy:

In the start of the new year I unfollowed the gurus, the digital prophets and all other self proclaimed experts.

The guy in the photo is David Shing, and he was AOL's Digital Prophet. I'm not even making this up. There is evidence: https://www.marketingweek.com/2015/07/09/aols-digital-prophet-david-shing-on-that-job-title-and-why-brands-shouldnt-treat-consumers-like-idiots/ (published July 9<sup>th</sup> 2015, read it January 6<sup>th</sup>)

Alright, but in the midst of all this noise there are people doing a fantastic job and they do it so well it almost looks like they are not trying.

One of those people is <a href="http://twitter.com/remixtures">Miguel Caetano</a>
